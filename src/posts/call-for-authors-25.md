**What we're looking for:**

- Challenges that are unique, fun, and fair.
- A variety of difficulty levels to cater to both beginners and seasoned players.
- Clear documentation and well-written solutions for each challenge.

**What's in it for you?**

**Interested?**  

Feel free to reach out with a concept or a challenge that you already have ready-to-go. Just make sure that:

- Your challenge hasn't been published before
- If your challenge needs a server, it has a Dockerfile
- Your challenge has a **clearly-worded** writeup that **completely** explains the entire path a player would take to get to a solution.
